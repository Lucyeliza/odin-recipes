        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This pancake is low effort and high reward. It is easy and quick to make, looks and taste great, and is able to be served sweet or savory.</p>
        <p>Powdered sugar is a popular topping but others include include peanut butter, maple syrup, fruit, and/or a salty meat like bacon; really if it would be good on pancakes or eggs, it's worth a try.</p>
