        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Scalloped potatoes do <strong>not</strong> have cheese. The addition of cheese <em>transforms</em> the dish into potatoes au gratin.</p>
        <p>A warm potatoes showcase of some creamy potatoes, some crispy bits, and 2 hours of doing somthing else while they cook. If you do not have an oven liner, I strongly recommend using a large baking sheet on the rack below the rack the 9x13 dish to catch any overflow while cooking.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 large potatoes, sliced to 1/4 thick</li>
            <li>1 chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 C milk</li>
            <li>3 Tb cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 can creamed corn</li>
            <li>10 strips of bacon, sliced into 1/2 inch strips, divided in 2 even portions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
            <li>Combine potatoes, creamed corn, onion, and half of the bacon in a 9x13 glass baking dish. You can arrange them but I just make them sorta level on top. Sprinkle the remaining bacon on top of the potatoes</li>
            <li>Combine milk, cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Pour over the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Bake for 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
